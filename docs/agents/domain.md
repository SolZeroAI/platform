# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** for ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If either path does not exist, **proceed silently**. Do not flag its absence or suggest creating it upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates these lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│   └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need is not in the glossary yet, that is a signal: either you are inventing language the project does not use, or there is a real gap to note for `/grill-with-docs`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because...
